# NoiseGrey

## Welcome welcome!

I have gathered some of my relevant coding experience in relation to the job qualifications/preferred qualifications.
I have yet to learn much about creating network traffic signatures, but I will update the directory with projects I take on to learn more about creating them!

# setup.py
This can be ran as:
- py setup.py
The purpose of this script is to install all python libraries necessary to run any file in the NoiseGrey repository.

# /SQL/ipv4-sql.ipynb
This can be ran as:
- py ipv4-sql.ipynb
This is a blog style jupyter notebook file that goes over basic MySQL and how to manipulate databases with Python.

# /cybersecurity-projects/basic-crypto-decrypto.py
This can be ran as:
- py basic-crypto-decrypto.py
This program decrypts basic cryptographic ciphers, hence the file name.

# /cybersecurity-projects/extract-md5.py
This can be ran as:
- py extract-md5.py
As the file name states again, this program just extracts the md5 hash of a file. 
* Note: The file you wish you extract must be in the same directory.

# /cybersecurity-projects/network-analyzer.py
This can be ran as:
- py network-analyzer.py
This program is not fully completed and returns an error when gathering port information. 
This program takes in a URL from user input and gathers information such as the IP address, hostname, and any open ports. I know I could've done this more easily with nmap, but where's the fun in that?
